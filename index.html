	Todo:
	-figure out a proper way to search for scientific stuff, that discussion trick is great, perhaps similar
	  -maybe specifically scientific papers via one of the inurl intext tricks,
	    would be broader than google scholar and all the benefits of how google 
	    modifies search results with AI based on your previous searches and 
	    guesses on what topic genres you are searching in
	  -maybe in general scientific stuff via a variety of heuristic keyword combinations
	  
	-figure out more modifiers. the majority of the point of this is to:
	  -sort out all the regurgitated BS that pops up on google. any popular
	  topic i search so much of it is shitty blogs quickly pumped out seemingly
	  just for ad revenue. it's to filter those out and to further organize
	  what's left, the majority of the useful pieces of information scattered across the web.
	 
	-like above, the point is to filter out all the regurgitated blog BS.
	  perhaps there is a way to show those blog type shitter sites and show
	  only the quality ones. im sure they are there, but much more sparse.
	  everyone's trying to sell an ebook, run ads, or run some shitty news 
	  blog repost thing
	  
	-maybe some video search tricks to filter out categories that aren't
	informational, for example when searching for meditation information 
	videos i often run into guided meditation/music. perhaps could be easily
	sorted out via some category and keyword filters
